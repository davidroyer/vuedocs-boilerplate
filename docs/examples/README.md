# Chapter 2: Creating Nuxt.js Applications

We will first create two Nuxt projects using their CLI tool. This will demonstrate how quick and easy it is to get started with customized Nuxt.js applications.

Following these first two apps, we will create a third project, which we'll use to begin learning the basics of developing and customizing Nuxt.js applications.

***There are two important items to note before continuing:***

1. For version 1.0 and higher of Nuxt.js, you will need at least version 8.0.0 of Node. Check your node version by running:

```bash
node -v
```

1. If you do not have `yarn` installed or do wish to use it, use can use `npm` instead. For example:

```bash
# Instead of:
yarn dev

# Use this:
npm run dev
```

# Getting Setup

There are three approaches to get started using Nuxt.js.

1. Adding Nuxt as a dependency and setting everything up manually
2. Using `vue-cli`
3. Using `create-nuxt-app`

We are going to use `create-nuxt-app` for now. It works as a CLI tool that will walk us through setting up our project by offering options along the way.

Before we get started with our first project, install it with the following:

```bash
yarn add -g create-nuxt-app

# Or with npx (shipped by default since NPM 5.2.0)
npm install -g create-nuxt-app
```

[Info On npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)

## Creating a Nuxt App

Now that we have `create-nuxt-app` installed globally, we're going to walk through the steps of using it to create our first app.

> Since we will have multiple projects, we'll want a directory to store them. That directory will be `nuxt-quickstart`. Each app will live in its own directory within the `nuxt-quickstart` directory.

## Nuxt App 1

1. Create a directory called `nuxt-quickstart` and then move into that directory

```bash
mkdir nuxt-quickstart && cd nuxt-quickstart
```

1. Let's create our first Nuxt project together. We'll call it `app1`.

```bash
yarn create nuxt-app app1
# Or With npx
npx create-nuxt-app app1
```

1. This will run you through options and to follow along, choose the options so that your result is as follows:
   ![alt text](/images/app1-setup.png "Logo Title Text 1")
2. Once completed, `cd` into `app1`

```bash
cd app1
```

1. Inside the `app1` directory, we can run our development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

1. View the result at localhost:3000. It should look similar to the following:
   ![alt text](/images/app1-dev.png "Nuxt Starter Dev")
2. Quit the development server

## Nuxt App 2

Now lets create another app and choose different options. Be sure to quick the previous application if you have not done so already.

We follow the same process as before but will choose *Vuetify* as our framework.

From the `nuxt-quickstart` directory:

1. Create your second application

```bash
yarn create nuxt-app app2
# Or With npx
npx create-nuxt-app app2
```

1. This will run you through a set of options and choose accordingly so your result is as follows:
   ![alt text](/images/app2-setup.png "Logo Title Text 1")
2. Once completed, `cd` into `app2`

```bash
cd app2
```

1. Inside the `app2` directory, we can run our developement server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

1. View the result at localhost:3000. It should look similar to the following:
   ![alt text](/images/app2-dev.png "Nuxt Starter Dev")
2. Quit the development server

## Nuxt App 3 - NuxtStrap

Now that we have gotten to sample using Nuxt with `create-nuxt-app`, lets create the app we'll use to begin building an application.

Our application will be called NuxtStrap, and we'll be using [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/) as our custom UI framework which is a Vue version of Bootstrap.

### Creating NuxtStrap

From the root of the `nuxt-quickstart` directory we'll create our newest application by following the same steps as before:

From the `nuxt-quickstart` directory:

1. Create the application

```bash
yarn create nuxt-app nuxtstrap
# Or With npx
npx create-nuxt-app nuxtstrap
```

1. This will run you through a set of options and choose accordingly so your result is as follows:
   ![alt text](/images/nuxtstrap-setup.png "Logo Title Text 1")
2. Once completed, `cd` into `nuxtstrap` and open it in your editor of choice.

```bash
cd nuxtstrap
```

1. Inside the `nuxtstrap` directory, we can run our development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

1. View the result at localhost:3000. It should look similar to the following:
   ![alt text](/images/nuxtstrap-dev.png "Nuxt Starter Dev")

Now we're ready to begin building our application, and will be using NuxtStrap for the remainder of Chapter 2 to do so.

# Project Architecture

Viewing our project, NuxtStrap, in an editor shows various files and folders already created.

You'll even see that inside each directory is a README providing helpful information about that directory.

Inside `nuxt.config.js` you'll see a property called `modules` that is an Array. By choosing BootstrapVue as our custom UI framework, it's already setup and ready for us to use.

It's important to understand that we could have just as easily set BootstrapVue ourselves inside the plugins directory. We could have created a file called `bs-vue.js` (or whatever we wanted), put the following code inside and registered it as a plugin in `nuxt.config.js`.

```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import BootstrapVue from 'bootstrap-vue'

Vue.use(BootstrapVue)
```

This trivial step is taken care of though by using the module.

# Adding Additional Routes via Pages Directory

We want 4 pages for our project:

1. Home Page
2. About Page
3. Admin Page
4. Login Page

Since we already have `index.vue` inside the `pages` directory, we're good for our home page but need to create the remaining three routes.

Do this by creating the following files inside the `pages` directory:

- `about.vue`
- `admin.vue`
- `login.vue`

While we didn't need to create an `index.vue`, we will be editing it. We are going to give each page the bare-minimum because we do not want to distract ourselves with matters outside the scope of this book. However, we will be adding to these pages as we move through this chapter and begin integrating additional functionality.

## Home Page (index)

Place the following in `index.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1 class="title">Home Page</h1>
    <b-button variant="primary" @click="modalShow = !modalShow">
      Open Modal
    </b-button>
    <b-modal v-model="modalShow" title="Nuxt Quickstart">
      <p class="my-4">Some modal content here...</p>
    </b-modal>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data: () => ({
    modalShow: false
  })
}
</script>

```

## About Page

Place the following in `about.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1 class="title">About Page</h1>
    <p>This is where you would put some content about the project</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Admin Page

Place the following in `admin.vue`:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1 class="title">Admin Page</h1>
    <p>Your admin settings go here</p>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Login Page

Place the following in `login.vue`:

```html
<div>
  <h1 class="title">Login Page</h1>
  <h2 class="h5">Please Login</h2>
  <b-button variant="outline-secondary" size="lg">Login</b-button>
</div>
```

## Adding Navigation

Now that we have multiple routes for our project, we need to setup navigation to test our routing by navigation between them.

We want our navigation to always be visible which means it needs to exist in our layout.

For right now, we'll place our navigation in `default.vue` file which exists inside the `layouts` directory.

At the time of this writing, the template for `default.vue` only consists of the following:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <nuxt/>
  </div>
</template>
```

We're going to place our navigation above the `<nuxt/>` component which results in our template for `default.vue` being:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <nav>
      <b-nav>
        <b-nav-item exact to="/">Home</b-nav-item>
        <b-nav-item to="/about">About</b-nav-item>
        <b-nav-item to="/admin">Admin</b-nav-item>
      </b-nav>
    </nav>    
    <nuxt/>
  </div>
</template>
```

### Understanding Our Navigation

We are using components provided by the BootstrapVue library. Nuxt provides the `nuxt-link` component which is often used for routing in Nuxt.js applications. It basically functions just as `router-link` from VueRouter though.

With that in place as well as our newly created routes, we can now test navigating between routes by running our project in dev mode:

```bash
yarn dev
```

If everything was setup correctly, you should be able to navigate between your 3 routes.

# Adding Page Transitions

To begin taking advantage of Nuxt's built in transitions, all we need to do is add a few lines of CSS.

By default, Nuxt uses the transition name of `page`, This is attribute we normally need to set on our own like so:

```html
<transition name="some-name">
```

With Nuxt however, we just need to add some CSS to being experiencing silky-smooth client-side routing.

Add the following to `default.vue` to begin taking advantage of Nuxt's built-in transition capabilities.

```html
<style>
  .page-enter-active, .page-leave-active {
    transition: opacity .4s;
  }
  .page-enter, .page-leave-active {
    opacity: 0
  }
</style>
```

# Setting Up Assets

Any assets such as images, css, scss, ect., that you want being processed through Webpack go inside the `assets` directory.

If you there are items you do NOT wish to run through Webpack then you should place them in the `static` directory. This will simply be copied over to the proper directory when Nuxt's build command is ran: `yarn build`

## Our Style Assets

We need to do 3 things to get our style assets setup

1. Add necessary dev dependencies
2. Setup a new directory and file(s) for our styles
3. Inform Nuxt to use the file for our project

### Style Dev Dependencies

We are going to use the SCSS syntax of Sass for our styles.
We need to install a few dev dependencies to do this through. We'll need `sass-loader` and `node-sass`. Without this, the `.scss` files will cause errors.

Run the following inside the root of the project:

```bash
yarn add -D node-sass sass-loader
```

### Our Style Files

Next, inside the `assets` directory create a new directory of `styles` with `app.scss` inside of it.

> Note: This directory could be named anything you like such as `scss` instead of `styles`. While I recommend you stick with the name of **styles** for now to ease the following-along process, you should feel free to use your preferred naming convention for your own projects.

### Additional Styles

While it perfectly fine to write styles inside our Vue component files, and I often do this myself, there is another way which is the approach we'll use here.

Within the `style` tags inside our `.vue` files, we can set the `src` attribute to the location of one of our `scss` files. It looks like this:

```html
<style src="@/assets/styles/your-vue-component.scss"></style>
```

Let's setup a few files we'll use later. Create a `components` directory inside of the `styles` directory with the following inside:

- `app-header.scss`
- `app-footer.scss`

We'll add the some basic styles to these files, so they'll be ready when we create these components.

#### app-header

Place the following in `app-header.scss`

```css
header {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  margin-top: 1em;

  nav {
    margin-left: auto;
  }

  .nav {
    align-items: center;

    &-link {
      &.active {
        &:focus,
        &:hover {
          background: #212529c4 !important;
          color: white;
          border-radius: 5px;
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### app-footer

Place the following in `app-footer.scss`

```css
footer {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  flex-flow: row wrap;
  align-items: center;
  padding: .5em;
  background: #eee;
}
```

### Adding Style Resources To Our Config

We need to let Nuxt know that we want to use these styles inside `app.scss`. We do that by using the provided `css` property inside `nuxt.config.js`, which is an Array so multiple resources can be added.

Add the following to `nuxt.config.js` inside your config object:

```js
css: [
  '@/assets/styles/app.scss'
]
```

## Image Assets

Any images inside the `assets` directory or any subdirectory within it will be processed by Webpack.

For our project, lets create an `images` directory within our `assets` directory to use for our images. Pick an image to use and place it in the new `assets/images` directory.

My image is named `image-example.jpg`. To reference it within a `.vue` file I can do the following:

```html
<img class="hero-image" src="@/assets/images/image-example.jpg" alt="Image Example">
```

Lets use our new image in `index.vue`. You'll need to adjust your code accordingly to match your image's name and file type. Otherwise the `template` part of `index.vue` should now be the following:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <h1 class="title">Home Page</h1>
    <img class="hero-image" src="@/assets/images/image-example.jpg" alt="Image Example">    
    <b-button variant="primary" @click="modalShow = !modalShow">
      Open Modal
    </b-button>
    <b-modal v-model="modalShow" title="Nuxt Quickstart">
      <p class="my-4">Some modal content here...</p>
    </b-modal>
  </div>
</template>
```

# Components Directory

Nothing takes the fun out of a project quicker than feeling overwhelmed by its disorganized. Utilizing the `components` directory to break our code into smaller pieces helps to avoid this unpleasantness.

We will use it to store parts of our UI that we want to render across all pages. We will create the following components in this order:

- AppNav
- AppHeader
- AppFooter

## AppNav

We're going to take the code we've already written inside `default.vue` for our navigation and move it into it's own component file.

Create the file `AppNav.vue` inside the components directory.
Take the navigation code and place it in our new file.

In addition to this component having the HTML for our navigation, we will set the `name` property of our component to `AppNav`

Your new `AppNav` component should look as follows:

```html
<template>
  <nav>
    <b-nav>
      <b-nav-item exact to="/">Home</b-nav-item>
      <b-nav-item to="/about">About</b-nav-item>
      <b-nav-item to="/examples">Examples</b-nav-item>
      <b-nav-item to="/admin">Admin</b-nav-item>
    </b-nav>
  </nav>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: 'AppNav'
  }
</script>
```

## AppHeader

We will follow a similar process for our header component but will need to provide some additional customization. We're going to use our newly created `AppNav` file inside our `AppHeader` file.

First, create the file `AppHeader.vue` inside the components directory. Secondly add the following to the component.

```html
<template>
  <header>
    <h1>NuxtStrap</h1>
    <AppNav/>
  </header>
</template>

<script>
import AppNav from '@/components/AppNav'

export default {
  name: 'AppHeader',
  components: {
    AppNav
  }
}
</script>
```

Now lets import this into our `default.vue` file inside the `layouts` directory.

Our `default.vue` file should now be as follows:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <AppHeader/>
    <nuxt/>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import AppHeader from '@/components/AppHeader'

export default {
  components: {
    AppHeader
  }
}
</script>

<style src="@/assets/styles/components/app-header.scss" lang="scss"></style>
```

## AppFooter

We'll setup our last component by creating the `AppFooter` file with the following:

```html
<template>
  <footer>
    <p>Our Footer Component</p>
  </footer>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  name: 'AppFooter'
}
</script>

<style src="@/assets/styles/components/app-footer.scss" lang="scss" scoped></style>
```

In `default.vue`, import the new `AppFooter` component and update the `components` property to include it like we we did with the `AppHeader` component.

This results in the our `default.vue` layout file being:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <AppHeader/>
    <nuxt/>
    <AppFooter/>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import AppHeader from '@/components/AppHeader'
  import AppFooter from '@/components/AppFooter'

  export default {
    components: {
      AppHeader,
      AppFooter
    }
  }
</script>
```

### Testing Our Styles

We are ready to test our asset modifications/additions now that we have taken care of the three necessary steps. Run your project in development mode to test it out and confirm everything is working properly.



# Adding Meta For SEO

Nuxt is packaged with Vue-Meta which helps us with SEO by providing us with the ability to easily customize our application's meta information

There are a few places where this customization takes place.
We'll set our initial settings inside `nuxt.config.js` and then update the meta for each route inside our `pages` directory.

## Project Meta Config

Open the `nuxt.config.js` inside your editor and locate the `head` property which is the one we'll be editing.

In many scenarios, you'd want this `title` property to be a combination of some text that is always present and text that is based on the current page being viewed.

If we were to leave everything with the default settings, this would not be possible. Our only option would be to overide that same `title` property in each page.

Fortunately another property is available inside the `head` config and it's called `titleTemplate`.

Go ahead and remove the line with the `title` property being used and replace it with the following:

```js
titleTemplate: '%s - NuxtStrap',
```

Now whenever we set the `head.title` property inside one of our routes, it will be replace `%s`, which gives us the combination we were looking for.
